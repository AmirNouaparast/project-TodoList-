# To-Do List

A simple **To-Do List** web application built with **HTML / CSS / JavaScript (vanilla)**.  
It allows users to add, delete, and manage tasks easily with a clean and responsive interface. All tasks are saved in the browser using **localStorage**, so your list persists even after refreshing the page.
